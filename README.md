#Selection of code from assignments in 3rd year module 'Statistical Data Analysis' of undergraduate physics degree at Queen Mary University of London

Fitting - Exploring least square fitting using the Python scipy.optimize.tool
IrisDataSet - Learning to manipulate datasets using Bunches
MonteCarlo - A Monte-Carlo simulation based on the 'Oop-Leon' paper (https://lss.fnal.gov/archive/1976/pub/Pub-76-019-E.pdfand) replicating and testing the statement that “Throwing events according to smooth distributions like that in Eq. (3) leads to an estimate of the purely statistical probability of clustering such as is observed here of less than 2%”.
